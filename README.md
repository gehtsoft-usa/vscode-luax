# Luax v1.1.2

This extension adds highlighting for Luax code.


## Installation

See the [article](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension) for complete details.

1. Install a VS Code Extension Manager package: `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`.
2. Run the manager in the root folder: `vsce package`. That generates a new `.vsix` file.\
There might be a chance, ecript execution is disallowed on your system. In that case run the following PowerShell command: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`.
3. Open the context menu of the created file by pressing the right mouse button and select _Install Extension VSIX_.
